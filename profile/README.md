## Talkee: Your Best Buddy to Learn Sign Language

### **About**

Did you know that the number of people with hearing loss in Indonesia is increasing every year? According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021, a staggering 1.5 billion people worldwide are affected by hearing loss. In Indonesia alone, the Ministry of Social Affairs reports that 7.03% of the 30.38 million people with disabilities are deaf. However, as noted by exomedia.id, the real challenge for deaf individuals isn't their hearing loss, but the lack of access and understanding from the broader public. Many deaf people face barriers that prevent them from participating in everyday activities due to widespread discrimination and a lack of familiarity with sign language.

üöÄ **Say hello to Talkee!** We‚Äôve developed an innovative Android application integrated with Gesture Recognition Model to help everyone learn sign language, making it easier for the hearing community to connect and communicate with the deaf. Our mission? To bridge the communication gap and promote inclusivity for the deaf community in all aspects of social life.
